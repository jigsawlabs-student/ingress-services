    "Now so far, we have seen that it's possible to expose our services externally by choosing a service of type `NodePort` instead of a `ClusterIP` service.  But really using the `NodePort` service is not a best practice.  Instead, we'll use an ingress service which will then route requests to any of other kubernetes services.  As we'll the ingress service works similarly to routing in flask.  It allows for external access, and also forwards requests to one of multiple services based on the requested path.  \n",
